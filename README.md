Eye Disease Detection System (EDDS)

Technologies: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, YOLO, MobileNet, Roboflow Platform

Designed and developed an Eye Disease Detection System (EDDS) web application aimed at detecting eye diseases from facial images. The system leverages a combination of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for precise eye localization and MobileNet for disease classification. Users can upload or capture images, and the system accurately identifies the position of the eyes before classifying potential diseases affecting each eye. The application provides an intuitive interface built using web technologies, ensuring ease of access and interaction. This project bridges advanced machine learning with practical medical application, contributing to early detection and intervention for eye-related health issues.

Deployment Process: Download the project files in a folder and run the local server on this folder. Just browse the local server and see the magic.
